# Big-mart-sale
Project Objectives:
The Data Scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim of this data science project is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
**Business Goal** : Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

Methodology:

Data Collection: The dataset consists of features like item type,cost, location of store, store type, sales of product in perticualar store, and size of store. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data. Model Development: Implement a linear regression model using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. Model Evaluation: Assess the model using metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Results

The linear regression model developed in this project demonstrates strong predictive performance. The model achieved an R² score of 0.493, indicating that approximately 49.3% of the variance in medical charges can be explained by the model. On the training data, the model achieved a high R² score of 0.86 indicating excellent fit . On the test data, the model maintained good performance with an R² score of 0.493 , showcasing its ability to generalize well to unseen data. Overall, these results suggest that the model is a robust and reliable tool for predicting medical charges based on the given features.
